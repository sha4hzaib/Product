This Flutter project emphasizes structured organization and reusable components:

Project Structure: 
Organized into folders for screens, models, and widgets, enhancing scalability and maintainability.

Screens:
Product List Screen: Displays a list of products with titles, descriptions, and prices using custom ProductTile widgets in a simple widget tree.
Product Detail Screen: Shows detailed product information (image, title, description, price) with a more complex widget tree.
Widgets: Reusable components are created in separate files to ensure clean, readable code and ease of maintenance.
